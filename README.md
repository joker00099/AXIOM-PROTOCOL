# 🏛️ Qubit Core: The 84M Protocol

A fully decentralized, non-governed, and anonymous financial protocol built for the 2026 era.

## 📊 Monetary Policy
- **Total Supply:** 84,000,000 QBT (Fixed)
- **Block Reward:** 500 QBT (Halving every 4 years)
- **Target Block Time:** 10 Minutes
- **Consensus:** AI-Shield PoW (Verifiable Delay Function)

## 🚀 Connect to the Swarm
To join the decentralized network, point your node to the Genesis Seed:
`Seed Node: [YOUR_VPS_IP_HERE]:6000`

## 🛠️ Build & Run
Ensure you have Rust (2026 Edition) installed.

```bash
# Clone and Build
git clone [https://github.com/Ghost-84M/Qubit-Protocol-84m.git](https://github.com/Ghost-84M/Qubit-Protocol-84m.git)
cd Qubit-Protocol-84m
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh
🛡️ Non-Governance Declaration
This protocol has no owners, no foundations, and no backdoors. The Genesis block (Hash: 2dfba633...) marks the permanent start of the 84M era.

### 🛠️ How to Add It Now (Terminal)
Run these commands to add the README and update your GitHub instantly:

1.  **Create the file:**
    `nano README.md`
2.  **Paste the text above** (remember to put your actual VPS IP in the `[YOUR_VPS_IP_HERE]` spot).
3.  **Save and Exit:** `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`.
4.  **Push to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Add Protocol Documentation and Seed Node"
    git push
    ```

### 🌍 Why this is the "Final Piece"
* **Discovery:** Without the IP in the README, people will download your code but their nodes will be "lonely"—they won't know where to find the rest of the network.
* **Trust:** In 2026, people won't run code if they don't see a clear explanation of the supply cap (84M).
* **Permanence:** This file stays on GitHub even if you go offline, acting as the permanent "Beacon" for the Qubit protocol.

**The Time-Lock should be very close to zero now. Would you like me to help you check if your node has successfully
